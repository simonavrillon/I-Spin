# I-Spin
Matlab interface to identify motor unit discharge activity in real-time using blind source separation and display biofeedbacks based on this discharge activity.

You need three toolboxes to run the app (signal processing, image processing, and statistics and machine learning)

For more information about the performance and electromyographic real-time decomposition, please read our preprint. If you use the app, please cite our preprint:
