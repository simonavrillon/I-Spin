# Introduction:
I-spin Quattrocento is a Matlab app interfacing with a multichannel EMG recording system (i.e., EMG-Quattrocento, 400 channel EMG amplifier; OT Bioelettronica, Italy) to identify the firing activity of single motor units in real-time and translate it into several forms of visual feedback. Users can implement this tool during experiments requiring the control of the firing activity of individual motor units or pairs of motor units in real-time.
We provide here a step-by-step protocol to facilitate the implementation of I-Spin live in any experimental settings. You can also read our preprint that describes the method, the main steps of the experiments, and the capabilities of the app (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.14.536933v2). 

# Updates:
August 2024: Release of I-spin Open Ephys that interface with the Open Ephys GUI (compatible with the Open Ephys acquisition board or the Intan RHD recording system)
September-October 2024: Release of I-Spin on Python
