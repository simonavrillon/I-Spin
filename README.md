Introduction:
I-spin live is a Matlab app interfacing with a multichannel EMG recording system (i.e., EMG-Quattrocento, 400 channel EMG amplifier; OT Bioelettronica, Italy) to identify the discharge activity of single motor units in real-time and translate it into several forms of visual feedback. Users can implement this tool during experiments requiring the control of the discharge activity of individual motor units or populations of motor units in real-time.

Note that the app currently only interfaces with one EMG recording system. However, we provide the entire set of functions and codes with comments to facilitate its implementation with other devices.

We provide a step-by-step protocol (User_manual.pdf) to facilitate the implementation of I-Spin live in any experimental settings. You can also read our preprint that describes the method, the main steps of the experiments, and the capability boundaries of the app (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.14.536933v1).
